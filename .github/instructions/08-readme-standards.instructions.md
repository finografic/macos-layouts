# README Standards

## Generated vs Manual Sections

- Sections between `<!-- GENERATED:*:START -->` / `<!-- GENERATED:*:END -->` markers are auto-generated by `scripts/generate-readme-usage.ts`. Never edit them by hand.
- Run `pnpm docs.usage` (or `pnpm tsx scripts/generate-readme-usage.ts`) after changing help configs, feature READMEs, or command definitions.
- All other sections are manually maintained and should be kept in sync with the codebase.

## Section Order

Follow this order for the project README:

1. **Title + tagline** — H1, one-line `>` blockquote, short bullet summary
2. **Usage** — generated from help configs (invocation, command table, per-command examples)
3. **Features** — generated from feature READMEs
4. **What's Included** — manual; describes what a scaffolded package ships with (core files, optional features). Must stay in sync with templates and feature registry.
5. **Generated Structure** — manual; tree diagram of a freshly scaffolded package. Update when templates change.
6. **Commands Reference** — generated quick-reference table with options column
7. **Development** — setup, local testing, docs links
8. **License**

## Content Rules

- Keep manual sections concise — prefer bullet lists over paragraphs.
- Do not duplicate information across sections. If "Usage" already explains a command, "Commands Reference" should only be a quick-reference table, not a second explanation.
- When a feature is optional (selected during `create` or added via `features`), label it as such — do not list it as always-included.
- The "Generated Structure" tree should reflect the base template (no optional features selected). Add `(optional)` annotations for feature-dependent files.
- Avoid verbose multi-option instructions. Lead with the recommended approach; mention alternatives briefly.

## Style

- Use H2 (`##`) with a single emoji prefix for top-level sections.
- Use H3 (`###`) for subsections — no emoji.
- Use fenced code blocks with language tags (`bash`, `ts`, etc.).
- Inline code for CLI commands, file paths, and package names.
- No trailing whitespace, no double blank lines.
- End file with a single newline.
